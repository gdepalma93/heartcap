    "## 1. Overview and Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "    Heart Capital, LLC was incorporated in January of 2018. HeartCap was founded by Trevor Orsinger(Lawyer),\n",
    "    Charlie McKenna(Wealth Advisor, CPA), and Grant DePalma(Ex-Athlete, Engineer). \n",
    "    The idea of the firm came from when the 3 founders shining light upon a lucky opportunity in time for wealth creation \n",
    "    in the form of an emerging uncorrelated and antifragile asset class with an asymmetric positive reward to risk profile \n",
    "    resulting from a step function type innovation in finance. This opportunity combined with the team's experience and a culture that aims toward\n",
    "    love yields the greatest probability of wealth creation for their partners. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Business Activities\n",
    "\n",
    "    Heart Capital, LLC is a multi-strategy CryptoAsset Investment management firm that partners with heart-centered High Net Worth Individuals \n",
    "    and endowment funds seeking the benefits from exposure to cryptoassets.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Heart Capital offers the typical hedgefund model to it's partners. \n",
    "    This includes a two percent management fee and 20 percent performance fee rebalanced quarterly with a 1 year lock up policy. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Heart Capital has partnered with Fidelity Digital as their institutional custodian providing a level of security that can be trusted by institutions \n",
    "    and High Net Worth Individuals that is not available to retail investors. The Heart Capital management team has increased their probability of producing \n",
    "    exceptional returns through their experience in the CryptoAsset Investment space giving them the required specific knowledge to properly play the volatility in the market. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Heart Capital believes in universal and timeless innovation and is committed to perpetually systemizing it's processes.\n",
    "    We believe that blockchain technology's innovation from double entry accounting to triple entry accounting is extremely undervalued.\n",
    "    The Crypto Revolution essentiaelly represents the building of a Global Decentralized Computer. Simply put, computers must compute or process instructions and store data. \n",
    "    A native medium to store and measure value is also needed in any digital ecosystem. The 3 projects that fulfill those functions are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IPFS respectively. \n",
    "    We believe that wealth in a digital world will be measured from a Bitcoin(Digital Gold) Standard. The deflationary and finite nature of Bitcoin's monetary policy explains\n",
    "    why it becomes more valuable over time. With a limited amount in existance in a rapidly growing digital world, every day that Bitcoin exists, it becomes more valuable.\n",
    "    With a potential marketcap of 7.5 trillion USD (Gold's Marketcap), Bitcoin's price can be estimated at 357,000 USD/BTC. We believe that digital scarcity can be\n",
    "    more valuable than physical scarcity represented by gold due to the infinite nature of the digital world where the Earth is finite. We believe that investing Bitcoin\n",
    "    and the core elements of this new decentralized computing system yields fantastic odds to generating generational wealth. HeartCapital aims to be the best performing\n",
    "    crypto investment fund in the season after the third bitcoin halving. We define Bitcoin as a digitally scarce, cyptographically secured, decentralized asset. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    HeartCap implements a proprierity asset allocation process that aims to minimize crypto investment risk and maximize alpha relative to BTC. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Heart Capital aims to build a fund that lasts by sticking to a 3 phase roadmap. Crawl. Walk. Run. \n",
    "     \n",
    "        - Phase 1 could always be referred to as the crawling stage. Phase 1 was initiated in January of 2018 as a small friends and family fund where Heart Capital\n",
    "        raised close to five hundred thousand dollars to invest in the emerging asset class. The friends and family fund will continue to be managed by HeartCap indefinitely.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Phase 2 could also be referred to as the walking stage. Phase 2 will be initiated on July 1, 2020 with the plan to upgrade operations and strategy\n",
    "        and raise ten to fifty million in capital from High Net Worth Individuals and other investment vehicles such as endowment funds.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Phase 3 could also be referred to as the running stage. Phase 3 will be initiated as soon as the management team feels like the fund is ready to run. \n",
    "        The running stage will include tokenization, quantitative trading, and tech upgrades. \n",
    "\n",
    "    There are 3 key advantages to investing in CryptoAssets. \n",
    "        1) Exposure to an uncorrelated asset: this reduces your overall risk in your portfolio\n",
    "        2) Exposure to an asset class with a positive assymetric Reward to Risk Profile\n",
    "        3) Exposure to white and black swans (Extremistan events in either direction)\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are an accredited investment vehicle like an endowment fund or High Net Worth Individual worth five million or more you are eligible \n",
    "    to invest in Heart Capital's phase 2 fund. Please visit heartcap.io to apply. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    If you are not an accredited investor Heart Capital is working hard to build a roboadvisor that can serve you in phase 3. \n",

    "## 3. Landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "    The CryptoAsset Investment Management domain isn't definitely defined because of the just recent emergance of a new asset class referred to by some as \"Digital Assets\" and by others \"CryptoAssets\".\n",
    "    According to Chris Burniske, a pioneer in the space, likes the term CryptoAsset because the word \"Crypto\", short for \"Cryptography: secure value passing\", \n",
    "    refers to the cryptographic security that is unique  to the value proposition of cryptoassets. The second term refers to the Unit of Account portion of the value proposition.\n",
    "    Polychain capital states, \"The emergence of bitcoin and subsequent blockchain technologies has generated a new digital asset class in which scarcity is based on mathematical properties. \n",
    "    Through cryptographic verification and game-theoretic equilibrium, blockchain-based digital assets can be created, issued, and transmitted using software.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The domain seems to emerge from a variety of domains like digital wealth management, investment management, wealth management(74.3 trillion of global assets under management), proprietary trading, and Venture Capital. \n",
    "    The clear way of defining this domain in the eyes of HeartCap are as following: 1)Invest in CryptoAssets 2)Benchmark Returns relative to Bitcoin's Performance 3)Raise outside capital. Ultimately, \n",
    "    From billionaire fortune management to small-level personal financial advisors, the heart of wealth management is a value proposition: it's a promise of financial returns and security that exceeds\n",
    "    whatever fees are associated with the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Key Risks for CryptoAsset Investment Fund\n",
    "        1. Regulation and Compliance\n",
    "        2. Limited Partner Experience\n",
    "        3. CyberSecurity\n",
    "        4. Process Automation\n",

    "        9. Human Error (Fat Finger Risk)\n",
    "       \n",
    "        \n",
    "    CryptoAsset Investment fund strategies can be classified as following:\n",
    "        1. Fund of Funds: Investment strategy akin to MorganStanley's propriety fund allocation algorithm where funds are allocated to fund manageers based on their performance.\n",
    "        2. Quantitative: Strategy relys on mathematical computations to identify trading opportunities in cryptoassets.\n",
    "        3. Index: Strategy that invests in baskets of cryptoassets rebalanced periodically\n",
    "        4. Tokenized: Strategy aimed to replace the illiquidity of venture capital by issuing crypto tokens instead of stock in new projects.\n",
    "        5. Managed Futures: Strategy where managers actively trade futures contracts available through bitmex, binance, or dx/dy exchanges\n",
    "        6. Mining: Strategy that looks to mine coins that start with a low hash rate and have a high probability of success relative to other coins.\n",
    "        7. MultiStrategy: Strategy that diversifies investment based on a variety of strategies.\n",
    "        8. Long/Short: Strategy that takes positions on both sides of market\n",
    "        9. Long Only: Strategy that only takes long positions\n",
    "        10. Macro: Strategy that invests in CryptoAssets as a bigger play in their overall global market strategy. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    Competitive Funds\n",
    "        1) Ikigai Asset Management is a long/short multistrat hedge fund investing in crypto assets. they seek to generate superior risk-adjusted returns \n",
    "        through the execution of venture stage pre-ICO investments and both systematic and fundamental liquid hedge fund strategies.\n",

    "    More than half of the 75 trillion dollar AUM in the wealth management industry belong to institutional investors like banks and funds. \n",
    "    The rest belong to individuals or smaller organizations. There is a shift wealth happening in the world today. \n",
    "    Wealth is being passed down from older generations to their heirs with the baby boomers soon to be gone. \n",
    "    There is also a rise in wealth created by High Performing athletes and entertainers, and women are also due for a rise in wealth. \n",
    "    This new money requires a fresh look on how it will be invested.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"New money Millennials will change wealth management because they are often more comfortable with digital technology than human wealth managers.\n",
    "    One key difference between Millennials and older generations; is that Millennials prefer handling financial transactions themselves with digital solutions.\n",
    "    Many Millennials will drop wealth managers that do not offer fast service and digital capabilities. One missed response could prompt a Millennial to change wealth managers, for example. \n",

    "        3) Assets Under Management \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ALthough the results of the crawling phase were in the low quartile of funds that still exist, the majority of funds who started in 2018 no longer exist. \n",
    "    Phase 1 has effectively served as a sandbox for the founders to learn lessons in space.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. Recommendations\n",
    "    The following solutions are reccommended for Heart Capital to implement during phase 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Build and Implement RoboAdvisor that mimics core fund strategy \n",
    "    2. Build and Implement Quantitative approach to cryptoasset allocation\n",
    "    3. Tokenize Fund\n",
    "    4. Automate Processes with AI Powered pipelines\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Offering a roboadvisor service will allow new money investors not protected by accredited investment invest in our stragies.\n",
    "    Offering a quantitative approach will increase return potential in drawdown seasons. Tokenizing the Fund will increase liquidity and security. \n",
    "    Automating processes will improve loyalty and partner experiences while decreasing the amount of time spent on tasks that can be automated.\n",
    "    These services utilize AI, Blockchain, algorithmic trading, API's, and cloud computing.   \n",
